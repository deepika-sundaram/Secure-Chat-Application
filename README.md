# Secure Chat Application

## Overview
Create a real-time chat application that emphasizes secure messaging, utilizing end-to-end encryption to protect user privacy. The application will allow users to communicate securely through one-on-one and group chats, with features such as self-destructing messages.

## Application Type
- Real-time chat application prioritizing security and user privacy through end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
- Supports one-on-one and group chats.
- Allows users to send self-destructing messages based on timers.

## Core Features
- **User Authentication:** 
  - Secure user registration and login system using JWT for session management and hashed password storage (e.g., bcrypt).
- **Real-time Communication:** 
  - Use of WebSockets for real-time messaging between users, ensuring immediate delivery of messages.
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** 
  - Messages are encrypted client-side before sending and decrypted client-side upon receipt to ensure secure communication.
- **Self-Destructing Messages:** 
  - Option for users to set a timer on messages, making them self-delete after a certain period.
- **Group Chat Functionality:** 
  - Support for secure group communication, including the creation of groups, adding/removing members, and managing permissions.
- **User Interface:** 
  - A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface designed using a frontend framework (e.g., React.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Security Requirements
- **End-to-End Encryption:** 
  - Implemented using encryption libraries (e.g., libsodium, OpenSSL, or Signal protocol).
- **Data Protection:** 
  - All sensitive information (e.g., user credentials, messages) securely stored and transferred using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES, RSA).
- **Self-Destruction:** 
  - After a timer expires, messages will be permanently deleted from both the server and the recipient's device.

## Deployment and Infrastructure
- **Hosting:** 
  - Hosted on a cloud platform (AWS), using Docker containers for deployment.
- **Database:** 
  - A PostgreSQL database will store user accounts, message histories, and group data.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** 
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines will be set up for smooth and automated updates.

## Performance Goals
- Support at least 1000 concurrent users with messages delivered in under 1 second.
- Ensure the application remains responsive and smooth across both mobile and desktop platforms.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Data Security:** 
  - All data transmissions will use HTTPS with SSL/TLS for secure communication between the client and the server.
- **Data Backup:** 
  - Regular database backups and a recovery plan to handle data restoration.
- **Usability:** 
  - Ensure the UI is intuitive and accessible, providing user feedback for actions like sending or deleting messages.
